# Agent reference: Testing

## Running tests

The repo is a Go workspace (`go.work`), so `go test ./...` from the repo root does **not** work — run tests per module. See [go-workspaces.md](go-workspaces.md) for why.

```bash
(cd broker     && go test ./...)    # broker module
(cd githubapp  && go test ./...)    # githubapp module
(cd cmd/agc    && go test ./...)    # AGC module
(cd cmd/gmc    && go test ./...)    # GMC module
(cd cmd/probe  && go test ./...)    # probe module
(cd cmd/proxy  && go test ./...)    # proxy module
(cd cmd/worker && go test ./...)    # worker module
```

Run tests locally before pushing to a PR to avoid burning CI. Prefer the narrowest scope that covers the change: a single module's unit tests, `-run` to target a specific test, integration tests for controller changes, or `--focus` for a targeted e2e spec. Run the full e2e suite only when the change is broad enough to warrant it.

## Integration tests

Integration tests use envtest and are gated by the `integration` build tag. They live under `internal/controller/integration/` in both `cmd/agc` and `cmd/gmc`. Use the dedicated Makefile targets — they set `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` automatically:

```bash
make test-integration              # runs both cmd/agc and cmd/gmc integration tests
make -C cmd/agc test-integration   # AGC only
make -C cmd/gmc test-integration   # GMC only
```

Or manually, after building setup-envtest:

```bash
make setup-envtest
export KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=$(.build/setup-envtest use 1.35 --bin-dir .build -p path)
(cd cmd/agc && go test -v -tags integration -timeout 5m -count=1 ./internal/controller/integration/...)
(cd cmd/gmc && go test -v -tags integration -timeout 5m -count=1 ./internal/controller/integration/...)
```

Unit tests (`make test` / `go test ./...`) do **not** require envtest — the integration packages are excluded by their `//go:build integration` tag.

## End-to-end tests

E2E tests run on a local `kind` cluster, are gated by the `//go:build e2e` tag, and live under `cmd/gmc/test/e2e/`. They split into three tiers (see [design §7.3](../design/07-test-plan.md#73-end-to-end-tests)):

- **Tier A** — GMC infrastructure (no GitHub required).
- **Tier B** — AGC lifecycle against the in-cluster `test/fakegithub/` server.
- **Tier C** — real GitHub workflow dispatch (requires App credentials).

Typical local run:

```bash
make e2e-cluster        # one-time: create the kind cluster
make e2e-images         # builds gmc/agc/proxy/worker/fakegithub, loads into kind
make e2e                # runs Tier A + B
make e2e-clean          # tear down when done
```

For iterating against a single spec without re-creating the cluster, see [kind-iteration.md](kind-iteration.md). It also covers pointing AGC at fakegithub vs. real GitHub via the `AGC_EXTRA_*` env vars and using `E2E_SKIP_TEARDOWN=true` to keep state between runs.

**Curl test image.** The connectivity, isolation, and metrics specs run a `curlimages/curl` pod. It defaults to the upstream Docker Hub ref (`curlimages/curl:8.10.1`), which is fine locally. CI sets `E2E_CURL_IMAGE` to a local-registry mirror (`localhost:5000/curlimages/curl:8.10.1`, populated by the workflow's mirror step) so the kind nodes never pull from Docker Hub — anonymous Hub rate limits (HTTP 429) were starving these pods and flaking three specs.

**Local-only tests.** Two Tier-A tests are excluded from CI by the `--label-filter '!local-only'` flag:

- `E2E_GMC_HPA_ScalesUpUnderLoad` — needs sustained CPU load to trigger autoscaling; flaky on 2-vCPU runners where the load generator and proxy pods compete for the same cores.
- `E2E_GMC_PDB_PreventsEvictionBelowMinAvailable` — uses `kubectl drain`, whose eviction timing becomes flaky under CPU contention.

Both pass reliably on a local machine with more cores. To run them locally, drop the label filter from the `make e2e` invocation or invoke `ginkgo` directly.

**Tier C.** Set `E2E_GITHUB_APP_ID`, `E2E_GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`, `E2E_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `E2E_GITHUB_ORG`, and `E2E_GITHUB_REPO` in the environment, then run `make e2e` (Tier C specs skip themselves at runtime when any variable is missing). The GitHub App key is in the macOS keychain; see the GitHub App reference memory for the retrieval command.

## CI workflows and scripts

CI must use the same per-module commands as [Running tests](#running-tests) above — never `go test ./...` from the repo root, which does not work with the Go workspace layout.

## Security scanning

The `security-scan.yml` workflow runs two supply-chain gates on every PR (and on push to `main`), independent of the unit/integration/e2e suites. Both have local equivalents so you can reproduce a CI verdict before pushing.

**govulncheck** — scans each workspace module for vulnerabilities reachable from our code (Go stdlib + dependency CVEs). It is symbol-precise: a CVE in a dependency only fails the gate if our code actually calls the affected path. Run it locally with:

```
make vulncheck
```

A finding usually means bumping the Go toolchain (`go` directive in `go.work` + every `go.mod`, kept in lockstep) for a stdlib CVE, or `go get`-ing the fixed dependency version for a module CVE.

**trivy** — builds each of the five images and scans it for fixable HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs in OS packages and bundled libraries. Run it locally (requires `trivy` and `docker` on `PATH`) with:

```
make trivy-scan
```

The four images we build from a minimal/distroless base (`gmc`, `agc`, `proxy`, `fakegithub`) **block** the gate — every package in them is one we chose, so a finding is actionable by bumping a dependency or the base digest. The `worker` image is built `FROM` the upstream `ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner` and inherits CVEs in the bundled node20 runtime and the runner's own Go binaries that we cannot fix without forking the runner; its leg is **report-only** (findings printed, never blocks). Runner-base CVEs are reduced by bumping the pinned tag — automated via the `docker` ecosystem in `dependabot.yml` and tracked in [`STATUS.md`](../STATUS.md) Q70.

Both gates are path-gated (they skip when a PR touches only docs/non-code files) and use `go-version-file: go.work`, so the toolchain version flows automatically.
