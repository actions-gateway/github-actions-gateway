# Project Status

Single source of truth for progress and priorities across the full project. `docs/plan/` holds the implementation detail; this file holds the ordering and the overview.

## Conventions

**Status:** ✅ done · ⚠️ partial (code shipped, pieces remain) · ▶ started · 🔲 ready · 🚫 blocked · 💤 deferred  
**Size:** S = one session · M = 2–3 sessions · L = needs a plan doc in `docs/plan/`  
**Labels:** `milestone` `security` `tests` `speed` `docs` `infra` `bug`

**Maintaining this file:**
- **Starting an S item:** complete it, delete the row.
- **Starting an M/L item:** mark it **▶ Started** here; create or update a plan doc in `docs/plan/`; delete the row here when done.
- **New item identified:** insert it in the Queue at the right priority position.
- **⚠️ item fully done:** move it to the Progress table as ✅.

Last refreshed: 2026-05-28 (5d ✅ — `TestProxy_TLS_RejectsHTTP2_ALPN` added to `cmd/proxy/proxy_test.go`: drives the production `ListenAndServe` over a self-signed TLS cert, dials with `NextProtos: ["h2", "http/1.1"]`, and asserts (a) the negotiated protocol is `http/1.1` and (b) a CONNECT over that handshake returns the canonical `HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established` status line. Verified to fail with `actual: "h2"` and a server-side `bogus greeting "CONNECT ..."` log when the HTTP/2 disable is reverted — i.e. it catches the exact PR #59 regression. Earlier landmarks: 5c Tier-A `ProxyConnectWorks` ✅, named-pipe ✅, GithubRegistrar ✅, eviction retry CRD fields ✅, M2 envtest goroutine-leak suite ✅, credential rotation ✅, M3 metric assertions ✅, M4 test gaps ✅, open docs items ✅, AGC rename ✅, go-workspace prefix-match ✅, Make UX Phase 2 ✅, e2e test speed ✅, envtest/unit test split ✅, M2 kind activeSessions check ✅, ARC alignment ✅, JIT config plumbing for worker ✅. PR #59 fixes shipped: workload NP `ipBlock` → `podSelector`, proxy HTTP/2 disable, IP-range fetcher `actions`→`api+actions+web`, AGC TLS pool replace → append, wrapper `--startuptype workerprocess` → `spawnclient`.

## Progress

Plan-level view. ✅ = all criteria met. ⚠️ = code shipped, specific pieces remain open in the Queue below.

| Item | Labels | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1: Wire-protocol probe | `milestone` | ✅ | [plan](plan/milestone-1.md) |

## Queue

Specific actionable items in priority order. Pick from the top; skip 🚫 items until their blocker clears.

| # | Item | Labels | St | Sz | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5e | Unit test: IP fetcher merges `api`+`actions`+`web` from real `/meta` shape | `tests` | 🔲 | S | Existing `TestHTTPFetcher_*` fixtures feed only `{"actions": [...]}`. Capture a real `https://api.github.com/meta` response (or hand-build one with all three fields populated by distinct CIDRs) and add `TestHTTPFetcher_MergesAllRanges` that asserts the returned slice contains a CIDR from each of `api`, `actions`, `web`. Guards against the regression fixed in PR #59 (`fix(gmc): expand proxy egress to api + actions + web GitHub ranges`). |
| 5f | Refactor + unit test: AGC proxy CA TLS pool composition | `tests` `security` | 🔲 | S | Extract the TLS-pool construction from `cmd/agc/main.go` into an exported helper (e.g. `internal/transport.BuildProxyTrustPool(certPEM []byte) (*x509.CertPool, error)`). Add unit tests: (a) pool validates a leaf signed by a system root, (b) pool validates a leaf signed by the supplied proxy CA, (c) pool rejects a leaf signed by an unrelated CA, (d) missing PEM returns nil pool without error. Guards against the regression fixed in PR #59 (`fix(agc): append proxy CA to system pool instead of replacing it`). |
| 5g | Unit test: wrapper invokes Runner.Worker with `[spawnclient, 3, 4]` | `tests` | 🔲 | S | The existing `cmd/worker/worker_test.go` covers payload reading and the message-framing helpers in isolation but never exercises the subprocess invocation. Add `TestWrapper_InvokesRunnerWorker_WithSpawnclientArgs`: build a tiny stub Runner.Worker binary in a `t.TempDir()` (Go test helper or shell script) that records `os.Args` to a file, prepend the dir to `PATH`, run the wrapper, then assert the recorded args are exactly `["spawnclient", "3", "4"]`. Guards against the regression fixed in PR #59 (`fix(worker): invoke Runner.Worker with spawnclient, not --startuptype`) and is also the natural place to extend coverage once 5a lands (assert `.runner`/`.credentials`/`.credentials_rsaparams` exist before exec). |
| 6 | [M3/M4 kind end-to-end validation](plan/milestone-3.md) | `milestone` | 🔲 | M | **Unblocked.** With PR #59 fixes, JIT config plumbing (5a, 2026-05-27), and the AGC apiserver post-DNAT fix (5b) all shipped, the test reaches worker-pod creation, Runner.Worker parses the job, the runner config files are in place, and the AGC can reach the kube-apiserver under kindnet. Run the live kind dry-run end-to-end against real GitHub. |
| 7 | [Egress proxy live curl validation](plan/worker-egress-proxy.md) | `security` `infra` | 🚫 | S | → M3/M4 kind end-to-end |
| 8 | [M2-tests remaining unit gaps (3–11)](plan/milestone-2-tests.md) | `milestone` `tests` | 🔲 | M | **Unblocked** — M2 envtest suite landed. 9 specific error-path gaps in the AGC token manager, agent pool, broker poll loop, and reconciler. Each covers a "silent failure" path of the kind that produced the PR #59 churn (e.g. Gap 4 swallowed deregister errors, Gap 7 missing AcquireJob error-metric assertion, Gap 8 generic poll-error backoff). Worth picking up after 5c–5g. |
| 9 | [M3-tests remaining items (H2/M/L)](plan/milestone-3-tests.md) | `milestone` `tests` | 🔲 | M | **Unblocked** — M3 metric assertions (H1) landed. Highest-leverage remaining items for preventing churn: **H2** (rerun-API 5xx is non-fatal — no test pins that contract), **H3** (decryption-failure fallback path is untested — silent payload corruption could ship undetected), **M3** (`activePodCount` Pending-pod branch — ceiling enforcement edge case). Worth picking up after 5c–5g. |
| 11 | [Ed25519 live probe — M-11b](plan/security.md) | `security` `tests` | 🚫 | S | → M3/M4 kind end-to-end (needs live kind cluster) |
| 12 | [M5 packaging — Kustomize overlay](plan/milestone-5.md) | `milestone` | 🚫 | L | → M3/M4 kind end-to-end |
| 13 | [M5 load test harness](plan/milestone-5.md) | `milestone` `tests` | 🚫 | L | → M5 packaging |
| 14 | [M5 polaris/kube-bench posture scan](plan/milestone-5.md) | `milestone` `security` | 🚫 | S | → M5 packaging |
| 15 | [M5 gVisor RuntimeClass validation](plan/milestone-5.md) | `milestone` | 🚫 | S | needs a cluster with gVisor installed |
| 17 | [Unit/integration test speed improvements](plan/unit-tests-speed.md) | `speed` `tests` | 💤 | M | low priority; pick up when CI latency is the bottleneck |
| 18 | [alerting.md](plan/docs.md) | `docs` | 💤 | M | deferred until a real Prometheus/Alertmanager setup exists |
| 19 | [Proxy features: allowlist, rate-limit, audit log, TLS, per-RG pool, X25519](design/appendix-g-future-enhancements.md) | `security` | 💤 | L | explicit non-commitments; build only when a named trigger fires |
