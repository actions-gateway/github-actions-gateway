# Project Status

Single source of truth for progress and priorities across the full project. `docs/plan/` holds the implementation detail; this file holds the ordering and the overview.

## Conventions

**Status:** ✅ done · ⚠️ partial (code shipped, pieces remain) · ▶ started · 🔲 ready · 🚫 blocked · 💤 deferred  
**Size:** S = one session · M = 2–3 sessions · L = needs a plan doc in `docs/plan/`  
**Labels:** `milestone` `security` `tests` `speed` `docs` `infra` `bug` `1.0-gate` (blocks the [Release 1.0](plan/release-1.0.md) tag)

**Maintaining this file:** see [`docs/development/maintaining-backlog.md`](development/maintaining-backlog.md) for the full rules (churn reduction, format conventions, anti-patterns). Short version:
- **Starting an S item:** complete it, delete the row.
- **Starting an M/L item:** create or update a plan doc in `docs/plan/`; delete the row here when done. (Skip the `▶ Started` marker unless you have a specific reason — the open PR is the in-flight signal.)
- **New item identified:** decide its priority *first*, then insert it at that position (not the bottom by default) with the next unused ID. See [prioritize new items on entry](development/maintaining-backlog.md#prioritize-new-items-on-entry). Batch audit-discovery items in one commit.
- **Parked item (explicit trigger, no near-term intent):** put it in [Deferred](#deferred), not the Queue; move it back into the Queue at the right priority when its trigger fires. See [deferred items live below the Queue](development/maintaining-backlog.md#deferred-items-live-below-the-queue-not-in-it).
- **⚠️ item fully done:** move it to the Progress table as ✅.
- **`Last touched:` is one line, date only.** Do not append session narrative.
- **Queue `Notes` ≤ 250 characters** (hard, lint-enforced). A markdown link counts its full `[text](url)` source length — count before committing rather than waiting for the hook. Overflow → move detail to the linked plan doc.

Last touched: 2026-06-20

## Progress

Plan-level view. ✅ = all criteria met. ⚠️ = code shipped, specific pieces remain open in the Queue below.

## Queue

Specific actionable items in priority order. Pick from the top; skip 🚫 items until their blocker clears. Intentionally parked items live in [Deferred](#deferred) below, out of the priority ordering.

| ID | Item | Labels | St | Sz | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="Q149"></a>Q149 | [v2 API M1: `v2alpha1` types + codegen](plan/v2-api.md) | `infra` `security` | 🔲 | M | Foundation: `v2alpha1` group `actions-gateway.com`, 5 kinds + deepcopy/CRDs/RBAC, CEL (immutability, maxLength 52, drop SecretReference.namespace, maxListeners=10, printer cols). No controllers; served beside v1alpha1. |
| <a id="Q163"></a>Q163 | [v2 API M2: EgressProxy + RunnerTemplate reconcilers](plan/v2-api.md) | `infra` | 🚫 | M | Blocked on M1 (Q149). Data/noun kinds: EgressProxy reconciler (owns Deploy/Svc/HPA/PDB), RunnerTemplate/ClusterRunnerTemplate + reserved-field webhook. Same-namespace only. |
| <a id="Q164"></a>Q164 | [v2 API M3: ActionsGateway + RunnerSet, multi-gateway](plan/v2-api.md) | `infra` `security` | 🚫 | L | Blocked on M2 (Q163). Verb kinds: per-gateway naming (52-char), AGC scoping by gatewayRef, templateRef/proxyRef runtime resolution + conditions, ownership/GC, optional proxy + NetworkPolicy (absorbs Q144). |
| <a id="Q165"></a>Q165 | [v2 API M5: migration tool + v1/v2 cutover](plan/v2-api.md) | `infra` | 🚫 | M | Blocked on M3 (Q164). Fan-out migration tool (v1→N v2 objects) + tests, Q147 dual-read label window (tenant: managed, allow-profile-downgrade: allowed), deprecation + operator migration guide. |

## Deferred

Intentionally parked items. These carry **no priority position** and are **not** picked from the top of the Queue — each waits on an explicit trigger before it returns to active work. Keeping them out of the Queue stops them from diluting the priority ordering. When an item's trigger fires, move its row back into the Queue at the position it then deserves (see [prioritize new items on entry](development/maintaining-backlog.md#prioritize-new-items-on-entry)).

| ID | Item | Labels | Sz | Trigger to revive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="Q74"></a>Q74 | [CRD conversion-webhook scaffolding (audit D7)](plan/k8s-best-practices.md#d-crd-design-polish-) | `infra` | S | Graduating the API from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1` (need `Hub`/`Convertible` stubs). |
| <a id="Q166"></a>Q166 | [v2 API M4: cross-namespace EgressProxy sharing](plan/v2-api.md) | `infra` `security` | M | A concrete operator ask for cross-namespace proxy sharing (same-namespace sharing already works without it). Adds inline allowedNamespaces consent, ConfigMap CA distribution to granted namespaces, dual-side NetworkPolicy, managed-IP refresh relocation. Additive on M3. |
| <a id="Q15"></a>Q15 | [M5 gVisor RuntimeClass validation](plan/milestone-5.md) | `milestone` | S | Wanted, but parked until after the v2 API ([plan](plan/v2-api.md)) ships. Also needs a cluster with gVisor installed. |
| <a id="Q11"></a>Q11 | [Ed25519 live probe — M-11b](plan/security.md) | `security` `tests` | S | Broker swaps RSA-OAEP session-key delivery for X25519 ECDH (Appendix G §G.6 / Q19), making Ed25519 the *secure* default. Until then Ed25519 is a less-secure performance opt-in (loses the AES session-key encryption layer); RSA-3072 stays the default and the probe gates docs nobody should reach for. |
| <a id="Q17"></a>Q17 | [Unit/integration test speed improvements](plan/unit-tests-speed.md) | `speed` `tests` | M | CI latency becomes the bottleneck. |
| <a id="Q18"></a>Q18 | [alerting.md](plan/docs.md) | `docs` | M | A real Prometheus/Alertmanager setup exists to document against. |
| <a id="Q19"></a>Q19 | [Proxy features: allowlist, rate-limit, audit log, TLS, per-RG pool, X25519](design/appendix-g-future-enhancements.md) | `security` | L | A named trigger fires — these are explicit non-commitments (see [Appendix G](design/appendix-g-future-enhancements.md)). |
| <a id="Q70"></a>Q70 | Flip worker-image trivy leg to blocking | `security` `infra` | S | Upstream `actions-runner` base scans clean (or near-clean). Worker leg is report-only in `security-scan.yml` because the base carries ~36 upstream HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs; the dependabot `docker` ecosystem auto-bumps it. When a bump clears them, set the worker leg's `exit-code` to `1`. |
