# Installation

Audience: platform engineer. This is the operator reference for installing the
Gateway Manager Controller (GMC) with the shipped **`actions-gateway` Helm
chart**. For day-2 operations after install, see [upgrade.md](upgrade.md). For
the full end-to-end walkthrough that continues past the GMC install into the
GitHub App Secret and the first `ActionsGateway` CR, see
[Getting Started](../getting-started.md).

The Helm chart installs the GMC and its cluster prerequisites **only** — CRDs,
RBAC, the validating webhook, the `namespace-psa-guard` admission policy, and
NetworkPolicies. Per-tenant Actions Gateway Controller (AGC) instances and
egress proxy pools are **not** chart resources; the GMC provisions them at
runtime from each tenant's `ActionsGateway` CR. The chart is the supported
distribution artifact; the `cmd/gmc/config/` kustomize bases remain the dev/CI
source of truth. For the full chart reference (every value, the templates it
renders, offline validation), see the
[chart README](../../charts/actions-gateway/README.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes >= 1.30** — the GMC's `namespace-psa-guard` policy needs the GA
  `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` API.
- **Node architecture: `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`.** Published images are
  multi-arch — one pinned digest (the OCI index digest) serves both, so mixed
  amd64/arm64 (e.g. Graviton) node pools need no per-arch configuration. Other
  architectures are not published.
- **A CNI that enforces `NetworkPolicy`** (Calico, Cilium) for the egress/ingress
  isolation controls to take effect. `kindnet` does not enforce egress, so the
  tenant-isolation guarantees do not hold under it.
- **Webhook serving cert** — choose one:
  - **cert-manager** (the default, `certManager.enabled=true`). Install
    [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) first; it issues and rotates the
    webhook serving cert.
  - **Self-signed** (`certManager.enabled=false`). The chart generates a
    self-signed serving cert and wires the webhook `caBundle` itself — no
    cert-manager dependency. **Trade-off:** the cert rotates on a `helm upgrade`
    that cannot reuse the existing `webhook-server-cert` Secret; see the cert
    behavior notes in [upgrade.md](upgrade.md#gmc-install-and-upgrade-via-helm-recommended).
- **A GitHub App** with a private key and installation ID. The chart does *not*
  consume the App credential — it is referenced per tenant by the
  `ActionsGateway` CR you create after install (see
  [Getting Started](../getting-started.md)). You only need the App registered
  and installed before onboarding a tenant, not before installing the chart.
- **Image digests** for the GMC, AGC, and proxy images (see
  [Pin images by digest](#pin-images-by-digest) below).

## Install

> **Chart source.** A tagged release publishes the chart to the GHCR registry, so
> install a released version straight from there — no source checkout:
> `oci://ghcr.io/actions-gateway/charts/actions-gateway --version X.Y.Z` (the chart
> version is the release tag without the leading `v`; verify its cosign signature
> per [release.md § Verify the publish](release.md#3-verify-the-publish)). The
> `charts/actions-gateway` local path used in the examples below installs the same
> chart from a source checkout — use it for development or an unreleased build.

```sh
helm install gag charts/actions-gateway \
  --namespace gmc-system --create-namespace \
  --set gmc.image.digest=sha256:<gmc> \
  --set agc.image.digest=sha256:<agc> \
  --set proxy.image.digest=sha256:<proxy>
```

`gag` is the Helm release name and `gmc-system` is the install namespace; both
are conventions you can change. Keep `namePrefix` at its default `gmc` unless
you are running two GMCs in one cluster — the operational docs and the
`namespace-psa-guard` policy match resources by that prefix.

### Pin images by digest

Digest pinning is enforced for all three images, at two layers. This is the
secure default: a digest is immutable, so neither the controller nor a tenant
gateway can ever run from a tag that was silently re-pointed.

- **GMC image — enforced at render time.** `helm install` / `helm upgrade` /
  `helm template` **fail** with
  `gmc.image must be pinned by digest: set gmc.image.digest=sha256:<64 hex digits> …`
  when `gmc.image.digest` is empty. See the
  [troubleshooting runbook](troubleshooting.md#helm-render-fails-gmcimage-must-be-pinned-by-digest)
  if you hit this.
- **AGC/proxy images — enforced at GMC startup.** The GMC **rejects floating
  `AGC_IMAGE` / `PROXY_IMAGE` tags and crash-loops** until the AGC and proxy
  images are pinned by digest.

Pin `gmc.image.digest`, `agc.image.digest`, and `proxy.image.digest` as shown
above.

For **dev/test only**, you can bypass the pin:

```sh
helm install gag charts/actions-gateway \
  --namespace gmc-system --create-namespace \
  --set allowFloatingImageTags=true \
  --set gmc.image.tag=<tag> --set agc.image.tag=<tag> --set proxy.image.tag=<tag>
```

Do **not** set `allowFloatingImageTags=true` in production.

### Without cert-manager

```sh
helm install gag charts/actions-gateway \
  --namespace gmc-system --create-namespace \
  --set certManager.enabled=false \
  --set gmc.image.digest=sha256:<gmc> \
  --set agc.image.digest=sha256:<agc> \
  --set proxy.image.digest=sha256:<proxy>
```

The chart generates a self-signed webhook serving cert and wires the `caBundle`
itself. Review the rotation trade-off in
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) before choosing this path.

## Key values an operator sets

The chart ships secure, HA defaults; most installs only set the three image
digests. The knobs an operator is most likely to override:

| Key | Default | When you change it |
|---|---|---|
| `gmc.image.digest` / `agc.image.digest` / `proxy.image.digest` | `""` | Always — pin all three by digest. The chart refuses to render while `gmc.image.digest` is empty. |
| `allowFloatingImageTags` | `false` | Dev/test only — opt out of digest pinning (render-time GMC check and startup-time AGC/proxy check). |
| `certManager.enabled` | `true` | Set `false` to use the self-signed webhook cert instead of cert-manager. |
| `namePrefix` | `gmc` | Only when running a second GMC in the same cluster. |
| `replicaCount` | `2` | Lower to `1` only in dev; production wants HA + leader election. |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled` | `false` | Set `true` if you run Prometheus Operator and want a `ServiceMonitor`. |
| `networkPolicy.enabled` | `true` | Leave on; needs an enforcing CNI (see prerequisites). |

A `values.schema.json` validates these at install/lint time (digest format,
enum values, etc.). The **full reference** — every value with its default and
description — lives in the
[chart README](../../charts/actions-gateway/README.md#values); this table is
only the common subset, not a duplicate.

## Verify a healthy install

```sh
# 1. Both GMC replicas are Running and Ready (HA default replicaCount=2).
kubectl get deploy -n gmc-system gmc-controller-manager
# Expected: READY 2/2

kubectl get pods -n gmc-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=actions-gateway
# Expected: 2 pods, all Running

# 2. A leader has been elected (the lease holder is the active replica).
kubectl get lease -n gmc-system
# Expected: a lease whose HOLDER is one of the GMC pods

# 3. Both CRDs are installed and Established.
kubectl get crd actionsgateways.actions-gateway.github.com \
                runnergroups.actions-gateway.github.com
kubectl wait --for=condition=Established \
  crd/actionsgateways.actions-gateway.github.com \
  crd/runnergroups.actions-gateway.github.com

# 4. The validating webhook and admission policy are present.
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration | grep actions-gateway
kubectl get validatingadmissionpolicy namespace-psa-guard

# 5. No errors in the GMC manager logs.
kubectl logs -n gmc-system deploy/gmc-controller-manager --tail=30
# Look for: "Starting workers" / "successfully acquired lease"; no repeated
# "AGC_IMAGE must be pinned by digest" (that means a floating-tag crash-loop).
```

If the GMC pods are in `CrashLoopBackOff` with an image-pinning error, you
installed with a floating AGC/proxy tag and without `allowFloatingImageTags` —
re-run the install with the three digests pinned (see
[Pin images by digest](#pin-images-by-digest)). For other failure modes, see
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).

Once the GMC is healthy, continue with [Getting Started](../getting-started.md)
to create the GitHub App Secret and the first `ActionsGateway` CR, or follow the
[Tenant Onboarding Checklist](tenant-onboarding.md) to bring up a tenant.

---

## Uninstall

```sh
helm uninstall gag --namespace gmc-system
```

The two CRDs ship as templates carrying `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so
`helm uninstall` **preserves the CRDs and every tenant's `ActionsGateway` /
`RunnerGroup` object** rather than cascade-deleting them — uninstalling the GMC
does not tear down running tenant gateways. To fully remove them, delete the
tenant CRs first, then the CRDs explicitly:

```sh
# Only after confirming no tenant still needs their gateways:
kubectl delete actionsgateway --all --all-namespaces
kubectl delete crd actionsgateways.actions-gateway.github.com \
                   runnergroups.actions-gateway.github.com
```

The install namespace (`gmc-system`) is left in place if you created it with
`--create-namespace`; remove it with `kubectl delete namespace gmc-system` once
empty.
