This document covers the network topology of a deployed gateway: which components initiate which connections, how `NetworkPolicy` rules implement the isolation boundary, and how to validate that isolation is correctly enforced.

```

All GitHub-bound traffic — from both the AGC and worker pods — is routed through the per-tenant egress proxy pool. Kubernetes API traffic from the AGC travels directly in-cluster and bypasses the proxy.

## Connection Inventory

| # | Initiator | Destination | Protocol | In-cluster? | Via proxy? |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | GMC | K8s API server | HTTPS (443 / 6443) | Yes | No |
| 2 | AGC | K8s API server | HTTPS (443 / 6443) | Yes | No |
| 3 | AGC | Proxy ClusterIP Service | HTTPS CONNECT (8080) | Yes | — |
| 4 | Proxy pod | GitHub API endpoints (see below) | HTTPS (443) | No (egress) | — |
| 5 | Worker pod | Proxy ClusterIP Service | HTTPS CONNECT (8080) | Yes | — |

Connections (3) and (5) to the proxy are HTTPS, not plain HTTP. The GMC generates a per-tenant self-signed cert for the proxy at provisioning time and pins it into the AGC's trust store (W7 / M-5). This protects the AGC↔proxy hop from in-cluster eavesdropping or impersonation by any tenant whose pods can reach the Service ClusterIP.

The GMC also makes one additional outbound call: `GET https://api.github.com/meta` every 24 hours to refresh the GitHub IP ranges used in tenant `NetworkPolicy` egress rules. This call originates from the GMC's own egress path in the system namespace, not through any tenant's proxy pool.

### GitHub Endpoints Reached via Proxy

| Endpoint | Used by | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `api.github.com` | AGC | GitHub App token exchange, rerun API |
| `*.actions.githubusercontent.com` | AGC | Broker API (GetMessage, AcquireJob, RenewJob) |
| `pipelines.actions.githubusercontent.com` | Worker pod | Twirp Results Service (live log streaming) |
| `objects.githubusercontent.com` | Worker pod | Action source downloads |

GitHub publishes its current IP ranges at `https://api.github.com/meta` under the `actions` key. The GMC uses this list to populate proxy pod `NetworkPolicy` egress rules and refreshes them every 24 hours. If `spec.proxy.managedNetworkPolicy` is `false`, operators are responsible for keeping egress rules current.

---

## NetworkPolicy Rules

The GMC creates three `NetworkPolicy` objects per tenant in the tenant namespace. The split (over a single combined policy) closes M-12 — worker pods inherit egress to the proxy and DNS only, not the Kubernetes API server. Only the AGC Deployment has API-server egress.

### Policy 1: `actions-gateway-workload` — AGC and worker pods → proxy + DNS

Selects all "workload" pods (AGC and worker) by the `actions-gateway/component: workload` label. Allows egress to the proxy pods (port 8080) and DNS only. Denies all ingress.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: actions-gateway-workload
  namespace: <tenant>
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      actions-gateway/component: workload
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress: []  # no ingress permitted
  egress:
    # DNS — needed for resolving the proxy Service name. Confined to cluster DNS,
    # not "any resolver": an open port-53 rule is an unattributed exfiltration
    # side-channel (Q105). Two OR'd peers cover both delivery paths: the kube-dns
    # / CoreDNS pods in kube-system (direct path), and the link-local block
    # 169.254.0.0/16 for NodeLocal DNSCache clusters where pods send DNS to a
    # per-node hostNetwork cache (Q136). Link-local is non-routable, so it does
    # not widen the exfil surface.
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 169.254.0.0/16
      ports:
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 53
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 53
    # Proxy pods — selected by PodSelector, NOT the Service ClusterIP. kube-proxy
    # DNATs ClusterIP → PodIP before NetworkPolicy enforcement, so an
    # `ipBlock: <ClusterIP>/32` rule never matches actual packets and silently
    # drops all proxy-bound traffic (the PR #59 trap). Selecting the proxy pods
    # directly matches post-DNAT destinations and survives proxy pod churn from
    # rolling updates and HPA scaling.
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: actions-gateway-proxy
      ports:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

### Policy 2: `actions-gateway-controller` — AGC → Kubernetes API server

Selects the AGC Deployment pods by `app: actions-gateway-controller`. Adds (additively) egress to the Kubernetes API server on ports 443 *and* 6443. Worker pods do not match this selector and so have no API-server egress.

Both apiserver ports are listed deliberately. NetworkPolicy port matches are evaluated against the **post-DNAT** destination port. Most production clusters expose the apiserver via the `kubernetes` Service at 443 → backends on 443, so a 443-only rule works. Kind (and any cluster where the apiserver Endpoints listen on 6443) translates ClusterIP `10.96.0.1:443` → `<node-ip>:6443`, and the policy evaluator sees 6443 — a 443-only rule silently drops every k8s API call. Allowing both ports keeps the rule precise (only apiserver-style ports) while working in both topologies. See [`docs/development/networkpolicy-port-matching.md`](../development/networkpolicy-port-matching.md) for the diagnosis and a worked repro.

By default this rule has **no destination restriction** (any-dest): the post-DNAT apiserver IP is provider-specific and not predictable at deploy time, so a portable `ipBlock` cannot be hard-coded and any-dest is the secure default (the breadth is the [§5.2](05-security.md#52-agc--proxy-level-threats-namespace-scoped) residual). Operators whose platform exposes a **stable** apiserver CIDR can opt in to scoping it: the GMC's `--apiserver-cidrs` flag (Helm value `apiServerCIDRs`) attaches an `ipBlock` peer per CIDR to this rule (ports unchanged) — an opt-in tightening, validated as CIDRs at GMC startup (Q145). Empty (the default) leaves the rule any-destination. See [security-operations.md § Tightening AGC apiserver egress](../operations/security-operations.md#tightening-agc-apiserver-egress-the-apiserver-cidrs-allowlist).

```yaml

metadata:
  name: actions-gateway-controller
  namespace: <tenant>
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:

        - protocol: TCP
          port: 53
    # Kubernetes API server — ports 443 and 6443 to any destination.
    # Both ports are needed because NetworkPolicy enforcement evaluates
    # post-DNAT: production clusters typically expose the apiserver on 443,
    # kind translates Service:443 → node:6443. Allowing both works in both.
    - ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - port: 6443
          protocol: TCP
```

### Policy 3: `actions-gateway-proxy` — Proxy pods → GitHub

Selects proxy pods by `app: actions-gateway-proxy`. Allows ingress only from "workload" pods on port 8080, and egress only to GitHub IP ranges (port 443) and DNS.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: actions-gateway-proxy
  namespace: <tenant>
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: actions-gateway-proxy
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    # Only workload pods (AGC and workers) may CONNECT to the proxy
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              actions-gateway/component: workload
      ports:
        - port: 8080
          protocol: TCP
  egress:
    # DNS — proxy resolves GitHub hostnames on behalf of clients. Confined to
    # cluster DNS (kube-dns / CoreDNS in kube-system) plus the link-local block
    # for NodeLocal DNSCache; kube-dns recurses upstream so external names still
    # resolve, but the proxy cannot reach an arbitrary resolver — closing the
    # open-DNS exfiltration side-channel (Q105/Q136).
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 169.254.0.0/16
      ports:
        - protocol: UDP
          port: 53
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 53
    # GitHub IP ranges — populated from api.github.com/meta, refreshed every 24h
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 192.30.252.0/22
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 185.199.108.0/22
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 140.82.112.0/20
        # ... additional ranges from api.github.com/meta .actions
      ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
```

The actual IP ranges are fetched at provisioning time and refreshed every 24 hours. The example CIDRs above are illustrative; the authoritative list is at `https://api.github.com/meta`.

If `spec.proxy.managedNetworkPolicy: false` is set, the GMC omits the GitHub-CIDR egress rule from Policy 3 — operators using FQDN-based egress policies (Cilium, Calico) provide their own equivalent rule and the GMC stops fighting them on every IP range refresh.

#### CNI-native FQDN egress mode (opt-in, Q208)

On a DNS-aware policy CNI an operator can have the GMC express the proxy pool's GitHub allowlist by **hostname** instead of CIDR, removing the dependency on the 24h `api.github.com/meta` feed. A v2 `EgressProxy` selects this with `spec.egressPolicyMode`:

- `CIDR` (default) — the standard NetworkPolicy + 24h IP-range reconcile described above. Works on every CNI.
- `CiliumFQDN` — the GMC emits a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` (`cilium.io/v2`) with `toFQDNs` rules scoped to the GitHub hostnames (`api.github.com`, `github.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com`, `*.actions.githubusercontent.com`, `*.blob.core.windows.net`) on TCP/443, plus a DNS-visibility rule so Cilium's DNS proxy learns the resolved IPs.
- `CalicoFQDN` — the GMC emits a Calico `NetworkPolicy` (`projectcalico.org/v3`) with the same hostnames as destination `domains`.

In either FQDN mode the standard NetworkPolicy keeps its DNS + ingress rules but **drops the GitHub-CIDR egress rule**, and the IP-range reconcile skips the proxy. The CNI-native object is named `<proxy>-proxy-fqdn` and is owned by the `EgressProxy` for cascade GC. The posture stays **fail-closed**: because the standard NetworkPolicy still default-denies GitHub egress, a CNI that cannot enforce the FQDN policy leaves GitHub egress *denied*, never wide-open — so the opt-in cannot silently weaken the default. The modes require, respectively, Cilium with `toFQDNs` enforcement or Calico with DNS-based policy (and the corresponding CRD installed); this is an operator prerequisite documented in [security-operations.md § Expressing GitHub egress by FQDN](../operations/security-operations.md#expressing-github-egress-by-fqdn-the-egresspolicymode-opt-in). FQDN mode is scoped to the v2 `EgressProxy`; the v1 proxy and v2 direct egress stay on the CIDR path.

### DNS Resolution

All in-cluster service discovery uses Kubernetes DNS (`kube-dns` / `CoreDNS`). The proxy pool is reachable from the AGC and worker pods via the `ClusterIP` Service name: `actions-gateway-proxy.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`. The `NO_PROXY` env var includes `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local` and the cluster service CIDR so that Kubernetes API calls are never routed through the egress proxy.

External DNS resolution (for GitHub hostnames) is performed by the proxy pods themselves, not by the AGC or worker pods — the AGC and workers connect to the proxy using `CONNECT <hostname>:<port>` and the proxy resolves the hostname on their behalf. This means the proxy pods must have egress access to the cluster's DNS resolver in addition to GitHub's IP ranges.

DNS egress on all three policies is **confined to cluster DNS** rather than left open to any resolver (Q105). An unrestricted port-53 rule (`to: []`) would let any pod smuggle data to an attacker-controlled resolver — an unattributed side-channel that bypasses the per-tenant egress-IP attribution every other egress path enforces. Confining DNS to the in-cluster resolver keeps resolution on the attributable path: `kube-dns` recurses upstream on the pod's behalf, so external GitHub names still resolve while no pod can reach an arbitrary DNS server directly.

Each DNS rule allows two OR'd peers, covering the two ways a pod reaches cluster DNS:

- **Direct path** — the `kube-dns` / `CoreDNS` Service in `kube-system`, matched by `namespaceSelector` on the well-known `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system` label plus a `podSelector` on the conventional `k8s-app: kube-dns` label.
- **NodeLocal DNSCache path** — the IPv4 link-local block `169.254.0.0/16`, matched by an `ipBlock` (Q136). On clusters running [NodeLocal DNSCache](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/) (`node-local-dns`), pods send DNS to a link-local address (`169.254.20.10` by the kube-standard `__PILLAR__LOCAL__DNS__` convention) served by a per-node `hostNetwork` DNSCache pod, which no pod/namespace selector can match. Allowing the whole link-local block is the simplest correct rule and **preserves Q105's attribution property**: `169.254.0.0/16` is non-routable and node-scoped, so it cannot reach an external resolver — the DNS-exfiltration channel Q105 closed stays closed.

Operators running a DNS service under a non-standard namespace or pod label must adjust the selector accordingly (or supply their own equivalent rule under `spec.proxy.managedNetworkPolicy: false`).

## How to Validate Network Isolation

The AGC and proxy container images are distroless (no shell, no curl), so `kubectl exec` against the running pods can only inspect process state, not run probes. Instead, schedule a short-lived `curlimages/curl` pod and apply the same labels as the workload you want to simulate — Kubernetes selects NetworkPolicies by label, so a curl pod with `actions-gateway/component: workload` is governed by the same rules as the AGC and worker pods.

> **The negative checks below only hold on a CNI that enforces egress NetworkPolicy** (Calico, Cilium, …). NetworkPolicy objects are inert without a CNI enforcer, and kind's default kindnet demonstrably does *not* drop egress for these cases — a "blocked" expectation will spuriously succeed there. Production clusters must run an egress-enforcing CNI for the workload isolation described in this document to exist at runtime. The workload-pod negatives below are automated as the Tier-A specs `E2E_GMC_TenantProvisioning_WorkloadEgressBlockedToNonProxyPod` and `E2E_GMC_TenantProvisioning_WorkerCannotReachK8sAPI`, observed enforcing on a Calico kind cluster (`make e2e-cluster KIND_CNI=calico`) on 2026-06-11 — see [the worker-egress-proxy plan](../plan/worker-egress-proxy.md#runtime-negative-case-enforcement-validated-on-calico-q7b-2026-06-11).

### Confirm a workload pod can reach GitHub via the proxy

```sh
kubectl run nettest-workload -n <namespace> --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --labels='actions-gateway/component=workload' \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- curl -x https://actions-gateway-proxy:8080 -sI https://api.github.com
# Expected: HTTP/2 200
```

### Confirm a workload pod cannot reach GitHub directly (bypassing proxy)

```sh
kubectl run nettest-workload -n <namespace> --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --labels='actions-gateway/component=workload' \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- curl --noproxy '*' -sI --connect-timeout 5 https://api.github.com
# Expected: connection timeout (actions-gateway-workload NetworkPolicy blocks direct egress)
```

### Confirm a worker-like pod cannot reach the Kubernetes API server

The `actions-gateway-controller` NetworkPolicy only matches pods labelled `app=actions-gateway-controller`, so worker pods (labelled `actions-gateway/component=workload` but not the AGC `app` label) have no API-server egress.

```sh
kubectl run nettest-worker -n <namespace> --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --labels='actions-gateway/component=workload' \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- curl --noproxy '*' -sI --connect-timeout 5 https://kubernetes.default.svc
# Expected: connection timeout
```

### Confirm nothing can open a connection *to* a worker pod (ingress default-deny)

Worker pods run untrusted job code and accept no inbound by design — the workload NP declares `policyTypes: [Ingress, Egress]` with an empty ingress rule set, so all ingress is denied (Q128). Start a workload-labelled listener, then probe it from an unrelated pod: the connection must fail.

```sh
# Listener: a workload-labelled pod serving on 8000 (simulates a worker pod).
kubectl run nettest-listener -n <namespace> --restart=Never \
  --image=python:3-alpine \
  --labels='actions-gateway/component=workload' \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- python3 -m http.server 8000
kubectl wait -n <namespace> --for=condition=Ready pod/nettest-listener

# Probe from an unlabelled pod in the same namespace.
LISTENER_IP=$(kubectl get pod nettest-listener -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.podIP}')
kubectl run nettest-prober -n <namespace> --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- curl --noproxy '*' -sI --connect-timeout 5 "http://${LISTENER_IP}:8000"
# Expected: connection timeout (workload NP denies all ingress to worker pods)
kubectl delete pod nettest-listener -n <namespace>
```

### Confirm a proxy-labelled pod can reach GitHub

```sh
kubectl run nettest-proxy -n <namespace> --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --labels='app=actions-gateway-proxy' \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- curl --noproxy '*' -sI --connect-timeout 5 https://api.github.com
# Expected: HTTP/2 200
```

### Confirm a proxy-labelled pod cannot reach the K8s API server

```sh
kubectl run nettest-proxy -n <namespace> --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --labels='app=actions-gateway-proxy' \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- curl --noproxy '*' -sI --connect-timeout 5 https://kubernetes.default.svc
# Expected: connection timeout (proxy pods have no K8s API egress rule)
```

### Confirm cross-tenant isolation

From tenant A's namespace, confirm a workload-labelled pod cannot reach tenant B's proxy:

```sh
kubectl run nettest-xtenant -n <tenant-a-namespace> --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --labels='actions-gateway/component=workload' \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"automountServiceAccountToken":false}}' \
  -- curl --noproxy '*' -sI --connect-timeout 5 \
       https://actions-gateway-proxy.<tenant-b-namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8080
# Expected: connection timeout (tenant A's workload NP only allows egress to
# tenant A's own proxy ClusterIP, not arbitrary in-cluster services)
```

### Confirm the GMC manager metrics endpoint is restricted to `metrics: enabled` namespaces

The GMC manager NetworkPolicy (`networkPolicy.enabled=true`, default) admits the manager's `:8443` `/metrics` endpoint **only** from namespaces labelled `metrics: enabled`, while leaving the webhook port `:9443` open so admission keeps working. Unlike the per-tenant policies above this one keys on the *namespace* label (a `namespaceSelector`), so the probe pod's own labels are irrelevant — only the label on its namespace decides. Verified at runtime on a Calico kind cluster on 2026-06-18 (Q83) and codified as the Calico-gated Tier-A spec `Manager NetworkPolicy` (`E2E_GMC_ManagerMetricsNP_*` / `E2E_GMC_ManagerWebhookNP_AdmissionStillWorks`).

```sh
URL="https://gmc-controller-manager-metrics-service.gmc-system.svc.cluster.local:8443/metrics"

# NEGATIVE: scrape from a namespace WITHOUT the label is blocked.
kubectl create namespace np-denied
kubectl run probe -n np-denied --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  -- curl -sk -o /dev/null -w 'HTTP_CODE=%{http_code}\n' --connect-timeout 10 "$URL"
# Expected: curl: (28) ... Timeout; HTTP_CODE=000 (manager NP denies the unlabelled namespace)

# POSITIVE: scrape from a namespace WITH the label reaches the endpoint.
kubectl create namespace np-allowed
kubectl label namespace np-allowed metrics=enabled
kubectl run probe -n np-allowed --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  -- curl -sk -o /dev/null -w 'HTTP_CODE=%{http_code}\n' --connect-timeout 10 "$URL"
# Expected: HTTP_CODE=401 (connection allowed through the NP; 401 is the metrics
# authn layer rejecting the missing bearer token — proof the TCP/TLS path reached
# the server, not the network blocking it)
```

Admission itself proves `:9443` stays open: creating any ActionsGateway (valid or invalid) returns the validating webhook's verdict rather than a `failed calling webhook … context deadline exceeded` transport error.
